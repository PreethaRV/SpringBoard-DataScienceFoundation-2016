Ideas for Capstone Projects with Titles and Blurbs:

Project 1.  Demanding and Non-Demanding Job: Identify job trends in terms of number of position increased for a particular job title - Data from Kaggle Competitions
•	Background: San Francisco city employee salary data is publicly available here from 2011-2014. Explore the data to find the job trend. 
•	The Aim: Find the most demanding job and non-demanding job.
o	Objective 1: Find each job titles counts that have increased from the past.
o	Objective 2: Identify correlation between the total pay packages of demanding jobs over the past.
